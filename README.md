# QuickPrefabs

QuickPrefabs is a Unity Editor extension that enhances productivity by providing a quick and simple way to find and select GameObjects in your Unity projects. This tool allows users to create a customizable list of prefabs and scene objects for easy access and selection.

## Features

- User-friendly Unity Editor window
- Customizable list of prefabs and scene objects
- Drag-and-drop functionality for adding prefabs
- Quick selection of objects in the scene or project
- Persistent data storage using ScriptableObjects
- Reorderable list for easy management of prefabs
- Automatic detection of scene objects

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuickPrefabs.git
```

2. Copy the `QuickPrefabs` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` directory.

3. Unity will automatically compile the scripts and make the tool available.

## Usage

1. Open the QuickPrefabs window:
   - Go to `Window > Quick Prefabs` in the Unity menu.

2. Add prefabs or scene objects to the list:
   - Drag and drop prefabs from your project into the list.
   - Or use the object field to select scene objects or prefabs.

3. Reorder the list as needed by dragging items.

4. To select an object:
   - Click the "Select" button next to the desired item.
   - If the object is in the scene, it will be selected in the Hierarchy.
   - If it's a prefab, it will be selected in the Project window.

5. The list is automatically saved and will persist between Unity sessions.

## Configuration

- The tool automatically creates a `PrefabListData.asset` file in the `Assets/MSCreativeTech/QuickPrefabs/` directory to store your prefab list.
- You can move this asset file to a different location, but make sure to update the path in the `QuickSelectWindow.cs` script.

## Troubleshooting

- If the window appears empty, ensure that the `PrefabListData.asset` file exists and is not corrupted.
- If changes are not saving, check Unity console for any error messages related to asset saving.
